# Exercise-01c-Twine-Story
Exercise for MSCH-C220, 27 January 2020

This exercise is should be an important step in creating a minimum-requirement solution for Project 01. You task is to create an original story in Twine. Next week, we will export it as a JSON file and make sure it works with our Python game engine.

As usual, the first step is to Fork the repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-01c-Twine-Story

*Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-S21 with your full name. Commit your changes.*

Press the green "Code" button and select "Open in GitHub Desktop". Allow the browser to open (or install) GitHub Desktop. Once GitHub Desktop has loaded, you should see a window labeled "Clone a Repository" asking you for a Local Path on your computer where the project should be copied. Choose a location where you keep the repositories for this class. Make sure the Local Path ends with "Exercise-01c-Twine-Story" and then press the "Clone" button. GitHub Desktop will now download a copy of the repository to the location you indicated.

Launch Twine and create a new project (name it whatever you want). Create a Twine project with at least eight passages. If you need more information about how to format the description or create links, you can review the [Harlowe 3.1.0 manual](https://twine2.neocities.org/#markup_link) or the [Twine 2 Guide](https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide). The engine we will be building will remove style markup, and it understands the `[[text->passage]]` or the `[[text|passage]]` link format.

After you have tested your project in Twine and are happy with the result, tap on the name of the project (at the bottom of the window) to open the menu. Publish to File and save it in this repository as game.html.

In GitHub Desktop, you should now see main.py and game.json highlighted. Add a Summary message at the bottom of that panel, and push the "Commit to master" button. On the right side of the top, black panel, you should see a button labeled "Push origin". Press that now.

If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see that your files have been changed (with a new date).

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-01c-Twine-Story) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
